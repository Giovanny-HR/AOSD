# AOSD (Automated Oil Spill Detection)

---

**Repository Name: Sens2Sea-Radar-System-Internship**

**Description:**

This repository contains the documentation, code, and resources for my internship project at Sens2Sea, which focused on developing a radar system integrated with AI algorithms for the detection of floating oily pollution on water bodies. The project aims to enhance environmental monitoring capabilities by providing real-time detection and alerts for potential pollution incidents.

**Project Overview:**

The internship project involves a multi-stage process, including AI algorithm research, development, radar data collection, coding, integration, testing, documentation, and reflection. The goal is to create a functional prototype that showcases the integration of radar technology and AI algorithms to detect and differentiate oily pollution patterns from other radar phenomena.

**Key Features:**

- Real-time detection of oily pollution patterns using radar data.
- Integration of a customized AI algorithm for accurate pollution detection.
- Testing and validation of the integrated system under various conditions.
- Comprehensive documentation of the project's methodologies, results, and insights.
- Weekly reflections on challenges faced, lessons learned, and personal growth.

**Repository Structure:**

- **/code**: Contains code snippets, scripts, and algorithms related to AI integration and radar data processing.
- **/data**: Stores sample radar data used for training and testing the AI algorithm.
- **/documentation**: Includes project documentation, technical specifications, and user guides.
- **/resources**: Provides links to AI research papers, learning materials, and useful resources.
- **/presentation**: Holds the final presentation materials, including PowerPoint slides.
- **/report**: Contains the detailed project report, summarizing methodologies and outcomes.

**Reflections and Insights:**

Throughout the project, I will be sharing my reflections and insights in the GitHub repository's "Issues" section, highlighting key learnings, challenges, and achievements. Your feedback and insights are welcome as I document my internship journey.

**Note:**
This repository is a reflection of my internship project's progress and outcomes. It serves as a resource for knowledge sharing and future reference.
